Public repo for the Fall 2018 Advanced Programming: Java class

9-12-18 : added folder of kattis solutions that I had been messing with. Will create separate folder for the Kattis Assignment

** 9-12-18 (2nd) : 'cold-puter science' -> problem I chose to write a Java solution with JUNIT tests for COMPLETE

10-8-18 : 'collections' -> collection assignment. Implementing a "bag" with JUNIT tests.

10-22-18 : 'threads' -> maven/src/main/java/threads -> multithreaded assignment. Just something small so that I could mess with threading like you told us too.

10-22-18 : 'raytracer' -> start of my translation of the raytracer into Java

10-30-18 : 'sqlite' -> my Java database assignment with JUNIT tests and pictures of database and test results.

12-10-18 : 'kotlin/parser' -> my final project: a top-down recursive parser that allows the user to change order of operators in the grammar. Still a work in progress but is reliable to use. Includes a few tests but the program was not data heavy and as such was difficult to write tests for.
